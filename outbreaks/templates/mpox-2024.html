<p>This is the final briefing report as we have discontinued line-list
reporting as of 2024-12-18. Our team completed a 100 days mission to provide
early situational awareness through open-access, global line-list data for the
2024 monkeypox outbreak. Check-out our <a
href="https://globaldothealth.substack.com/">newsletter</a> to see what's
happening next with our data. More information on this outbreak can be found in our

<ul>
    <li>On 05 November 2024, G.h updated our case status definition for
        ‘suspected’ cases to align with WHO’s description from their <a
            href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/">website</a>,
        “In some countries, suspected cases that undergo testing are not
        removed from the count, regardless of whether the test result is
        positive (confirmed case) or negative (discarded case). Moreover, not
        all countries have robust surveillance systems for mpox, meaning
        reported case counts likely underestimate the extent of community
        transmission."  G.h adjusted our discarded / suspected case numbers in
        our linelist database to align with WHO case numbers for suspected
        cases. G.h is using official data for suspected cases from the Rwanda
        Ministry of Health since WHO has not included suspected cases for
        Rwanda in their reporting. G.h is using official data for suspected
        cases from the Rwanda Ministry of Health since WHO has not included
        suspected cases for Rwanda in their reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>Uganda</strong>: G.h only provide confirmed case counts for Uganda.</li>
    <li><strong>Kenya</strong>: Location of death is not provided by source. G.h is unable to capture this death in a
        linelist format. Deaths by country are provided in a table format in our briefing report.</li>
    <li>G.h has assigned discarded (negative) case status when data is provided by source [i.e. Kenya, CAR].
        G.h counts for suspected cases may not align with WHO dashboard:
        "In some countries, suspected cases that undergo testing are not removed from the count,
        regardless of whether the test result is positive (confirmed case) or negative (discarded case).
        Moreover, not all countries have robust surveillance systems for mpox, meaning reported case
        counts are likely underestimate the extent of community transmission." [WHO]</li>
    <li>G.h death counts by country aligns with WHO’s dashboard for data as of 2024-10-20.</li>
