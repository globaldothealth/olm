    <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 1</strong>: Number of cumulative confirmed and probable cases
        by date of onset. Where date of onset is not available, it is
        estimated from the date of first consult/hospitalisation or date
        of death, by shifting the value by the delay distribution mean.
        Only cases where date of onset is known or can be estimated are shown.

    <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 2</strong>: Number of cumulative confirmed and probable cases
        stratified by district. Date of onset is estimated when not available as in Figure 1.
        Only cases where date of onset is known or can be estimated and have a corresponding
        district are shown.

        <strong>Figure 3</strong>: Age and gender distribution of
        Marburg 2023 confirmed cases in Equatorial Guinea.
        {{ pc_valid_age_gender }}% of confirmed cases include
        sufficient metadata to be included in this figure. When reported
        age ranges span multiple age categories, counts are evenly
        distributed among the categories that capture the reported age
        range.

        onset and death. Only includes cases that have both date of onset
